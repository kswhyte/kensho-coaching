        <h3>Kensho Coaching is Transformational Coaching</h3>

        <p>
          Traditionally, the kensho experience is a pure realization of Self without duality of "seer" and "the thing seen."
          In Zen, it is satori--a nondual state of awareness.
          Simply put, it denotes a mind emancipated by emptiness.
          The concept of "emptiness" regards seeing the phenomena of nature without self or anything pertaining to self.
          A kensho experience is thus a moment of seeing reality through a pure, unfiltered lens, rather than through the lens of our subjective experience of self.
          It is the mind attending to no themes or stories of one's self, knowing that the projection of images, meaning, categories, and labels we asign to objects are not our true essence, nature, identity, or Self.

          A movie projects images and stories via light onto a screen, just as the mind projects meaning and forms identity through projecting labels and meaning onto experiences.
          Every experience we have consists of both positive and negative aspects, yet we tend to perceive those experiences as having only positive or only negative characteristics.
          As we perceive our experiences, always in relation to another or something other than our self, we may associate those people or things as serving us (positive) or dis-serving us (negative).
          Each person experiences life and reality in his/her own unique way because of the specific orientation of his/her personality.
          Investigating the personality and all of its projections, polarities, and delusions can be complex.
          Kensho coaching is a simpler approach to transformation in which tools of somatic-psychology are leveraged in tangent with neutralizing emotional triggers.
          By working through a step-by-step process of re-balancing lopsided perceptions and re-integrating a new sense of self, a deeper sense of meaning, purpose, and healthy identity can be realized and embodied.
          Gratitude ensues. Empowerment is felt. True Self-reliance is formed.

          On a soul level, life is about digesting experiences and learning from them in such a way that a sense of gratitude and centeredness result.
          From each new achieved quantum state or reality that resuls in gratitude, we are then able to move into a new quantum field of discovery and awarness of self through new experiences.
          This is our human potential--to not only live but thrive beyond the limits of ego-centric boudaries at any level. To unite with conscious unity with the Source of Self/existence and your own Soul is to live with the utmost powerful inner self-reliance.
          Kensho can be seen as an initial or opening experience or meditative state consisting of no themes or stories that fog or cast a veil over this union of Self with true nature or essences.
